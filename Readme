There are three files with the following descriptions:
HeatMiser.py
    This files runs the algorithm one time and produces the results as a terminal output asked by the assignement.
    It does not always converge nicely so it will shut down if it has not converged by a 100 trials.
HeatMiserData.py
    This just does the algorithm for a 100 times and does a 100 trials (can be changed to whatever value is desired.) and outputs it into a csv file.
BiggerDataHeatmiser.py
    This one does it repeatedely for more trials to test how this works scalably.

 In order to run this just type python3 name of file.
